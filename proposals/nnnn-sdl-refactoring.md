# Feature name

* Proposal: [SDL-NNNN](nnnn-sdl-refactoring.md)
* Author: [Maxim Ghiumiusliu](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/mghiumiusliu)
* Status: **Draft**
* Impacted Platforms: Core

## Introduction



## Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its drawbacks. If it's completely new functionality that cannot be emulated, motivate why this new functionality would help SDL mobile developers or OEMs provide users with useful functionality.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new protocol changes or RPC changes, show the full XML of all changes and how they changed. Show documentation comments detailing what it does. Show how it might be implemented on the Mobile Library and Core. The detail in this section should be sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to reasonably implement the feature and future [smartdevicelink.com](https://www.smartdevicelink.com) guides.

## Impact on existing code

Describe the impact that this change will have on existing code. Will some SDL integrations stop compiling due to this change? Will applications still compile but produce different behavior than they used to? Is it possible to migrate existing SDL code to use a new feature or API automatically?

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and why you chose this approach instead.
